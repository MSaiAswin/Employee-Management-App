# Task 9

## Steps
 - Here I have created a file .github/workflows/main.yml
 - This file defines two jobs.
 - First one defines the job to build the empapp image from src directory and push it to my docker hub registry
 - Second job is to get an OK response from the fakedeployserver. This runs a python script that I have written challenge.py
 - now when I push these changes to github, these jobs should aytomatically run.
